# monthly-code-challenges

This repository will consist of our monthly code challenges. This is what that entails:

- A new challenge is released the first week of every month
- The challenge would be something fairly simple and shouldn't take a very large amount of time to complete or detract from our regular responsibilities; the monthly aspect is meant to give people ample time to work through it
- I'd likely pull challenge questions from various sources (e.g., Google's Code Jam archives)
- We can discuss and review solutions in a separate teams chat meant for this, maybe also using a repo on bitbucket so we can view everyone's solutions
- This would be optional participation of course, if you don't want to or can't that's entirely fine
- THE TWIST: we must complete the challenges using a randomly selected programming language for that month

To participate:

- Fork this repository
- Check out a month's branch
- Use VSCode + the devcontainer definition to get working in an environment for the language of choice
- Push your solution to a branch on your fork and open a pull request against this repo's branch
